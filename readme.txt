Add a shortcode that outputs HTML markup with the next and previous posts for the current blog post the user is viewing.

== How to use ==
After installing and activating the plugin, just add the shortcode [prev_next_posts] to your site using either Classic Text editor, the Gutenberg editor, Elementor shortcode widget or whatever page builder you're using.

== Screenshots ==
1. This is the plugin working in one site
2. This is the plugin working on another. I have the CSS styles ready but they are coming in the second version, like in a dropdown setting in the backend.
